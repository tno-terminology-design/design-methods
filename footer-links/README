The .json files in this directory are meant to be used to create a consistent layout across the documentation sites of the various tools, methods, specifications, etc.

The way to achieve this in a particular repo is as follows.

1. Create a copy of the directory `https://github.com/tno-terminology-design/tev2-specifications/tree/main/footer-links` in the directory in your repo that contains `docusaurus.config.js`.

2. Edit `docusaurus.config.js` and make sure the following lines are at the beginning of that file:

~~~ json
const terminology_design = require('./footer-links/terminology-design.json');
const manuals = require('./footer-links/manuals.json');
const specifications = require('./footer-links/specifications.json');
const repositories = require('./footer-links/repositories.json');
const copyright = require('./footer-links/copyright.json');
~~~

3 Edit the `footer` section in `docusaurus.config.js`, adjusting its `links` field and `copyright` field so that they read (of course, if you don't want any of the `links` items, just leave them out; also, you can add your own items):

~~~ json
    footer: {
      ...
      links: [
        { title: terminology_design.title, items: terminology_design.items },
        { title: manuals.title, items: manuals.items },
        { title: specifications.title, items: specifications.items, },
        { title: repositories.title, items: repositories.items },
      ],
      ...
      copyright: copyright.text.replace("[20XX-20YY]",`2022-${new Date().getFullYear()}`)
      ...
    },
~~~

4. Make sure to regularly update the contents of the `footer-links`-directory that you have created, which you can do in a github action (or similar) when you deploy your site. Alternatively, you can do that 'manually' while updating your repository, by executing either `update.ps1` in PowerShell, as in

~~~ ps
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\update.ps1"
~~~

or `update.sh` in Bash, as in

~~~ Bash
chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
~~~

At this moment, the Bash script has not been tested at all; the PS-script has been run a few Times. So there may be issues. If you encounter ThemeProvider, please raise an issue (preferably with a pull request that suggests a resolution).
