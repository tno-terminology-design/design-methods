### Who benefits

For who are we doing this, what can this person do with it and what is the unique result?

Are you going to be faster, better, easier-going in writing texts? Will you be better understood by a larger audience?

The brief answer is *yes*. Just imprint this paragraph for more backing:

#### Why are we doing this?

**Authors and curators** of texts can follow this guideline for terminology design in order to **create their terminology**, **invent smart criteria to distinguish their concepts from others**, thereby identifying their own concepts clearer, understand their peers better and finally **be understood better** and quicker by others.

Oops the magic word is in there! Have you been able to locate it? No? Keep going!

### Reality check

Most term definitions in the world do not comply with the distinguishing-criteria rule, and that’s the uniqueness of this Method: it’s easy to follow and the result is an improved terminology.
